## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

Using grid + clamp() for desktop version to calculate padding, margin, to have the best behavior I can do.


### Continued development

I'm going to work on the clamp method with Utopia tools to calculate margin, padding, etc ...
It's a very smart tool(Utopia)

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Very useful.
